moodle-local_jwplayer
=====================

**Plugin currently in beta, not safe for production systems**

This is a moodle local plugin (https://docs.moodle.org/dev/Local_plugins) that provides a *core_media_player* subclass and a *core_media_renderer* subclass to embed audio/video with the JW Player (http://www.jwplayer.com/).

This plugin is based on the moodle-filter_jwplayer plugin (https://github.com/lucisgit/moodle-filter_jwplayer, https://moodle.org/plugins/view/filter_jwplayer) from Ruslan Kabalin (and Lancaster University: @lucisgit).

An adjusted version of the filter_jwplayer that makes use of this local_jwplayer plugin can be found here: https://github.com/sudile/moodle-filter_jwplayer
